We did not use much AI, the only form of AI that was used was to fix problems with flutter and dart itself or visual studio code, for example I used Grok to tell me why I couldn't run my project in the OneDrive as it was coming into an error with it, what I learned was 
to keep the directory in another file location in my explorer so one drive couldn't manipulate it and keep certain files still running preventing me from running and testing anything.
